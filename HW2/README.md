# Assignment 2

## Part 1: Theory (nosubmit)

TODO

## Part 2: Programming Part

Compile & run

```
javac *.java
java ImageProcessor [INPUT_IMAGE.RGB] [OBJECT_IMAGE_1.RGB, OBJECT_IMAGE_2.RGB, ...]
```

Additionally, a few points:

- refining the image through erosion & dilation takes some time ~15s
- the bounding box is still not as precise as I want it to be
- I used a different algorithm from lecture and found it to be less performant than those discussed in Piazza
- this assignment, even though functional since Oct 4, was submitted late on Oct 9 at 1:30pm
  - as I was talking to Vishal Singh in his office hours at 1pm, he rightfully pointed out that it was already past the submission time
  - so I prepared the files for submission without changing them and submitted it to DEN
  - I thought the submission date was Oct 12 instead of Oct 9, apologies for the honest mistake

It was a difficult but enjoyable assignment, please do give it a look üëç
